# This is a practice 'form' I made, to collect some information from the user.
# The script asks the user for their name, age, location, and interests. It then creates a new variable called 'reply' using a string, including the four variables created from user input. The script then prints 'reply.'

print("Hello, we would like some basic information on you before we begin")

name = input("What is your name?" )
age = input("How old are you?" )
Locale = input("Where are you located?" )
Interests = input("What are some of your interests?")

reply = f"Hi {name}, you are {age} yrs old, from {Locale}, and interestd in {Interests}."
print(reply)

# String concatenation
# You can combine strings and variables by using the + operator.

first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name

print(full_name)

# If the variable is not a string, you need to convert it using the str() function.

name = input("What is your name? ")
age = int(input("How old are you? ")) # Convert the input to an integer

print("Hi, " + name + "! Next year, you will be " + str(age + 1) + " years old.")
